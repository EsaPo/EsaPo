### Hi,
I am also a passionate enthusiast of Linux and home automation systems, and on these pages you will find, among other things, configuration files for my Home Assistant and configuration files related to Linux.

You can also visit my blog (https://fasted.dy.fi) to see more, but unfortunately these writings are in Finnish for now.
