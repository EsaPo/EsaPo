### Hi,
I am a passionate enthusiast of Linux and home automation systems, and nowadays I'm learning Full stack programming in my freetime. 

Here you can found my codings for some applications what I have done and here are also my old docker compose configuration files what I have use with Home Assistant.

You can also visit my website ([https://eddyshomepages.fi](https://eddyshomepages.fi)) to see more what I have done, but unfortunately main part of these writings are still in Finnish.
