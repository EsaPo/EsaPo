### Hi,
I am a passionate enthusiast of Linux and home automation systems, and nowadays I'm learning Full stack programming in my freetime. Here you can found my code for few applications what I have done. Here you can also my old configuration files for my Home Assistant.

You can also visit my website ([https://eddyshomepages.fi](https://eddyshomepages.fi)) to see more, but unfortunately main part of these writings are in Finnish for now.
